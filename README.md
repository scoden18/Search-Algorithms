# Search-Algorithms

Just wanted to visualize some search algorithms.
Pretty sure the ones that check everything are Dijkstra.
The ones that aim at the target might be Greedy Best First.
The code probably isn't optimized very well. I made this in a day, sue me.
It's finals week and I did this instead of studying.

The options in options.txt change options for all four algorithms in case you want to seed the random and compare them side by side.

Pretty much all of my comments on what stuff does are in dijkstra_no_diag_motion
